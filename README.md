# 04 Web APIs: Plant Quiz

Using javascript, HTML, and CSS this page creates a quiz about plants. When clicking start, the quiz will begin. It is timed and scored based on the number of correctly answered questions in the time allowed. For every question that is answered incorrectly, 15 seconds are deducted from the timer. For every question that is answered correctly, 20 points are added to the score at the end. There are five multiple choice questions and 75 seconds to answer them. When the quiz is completed the page will display your score and number of correctly answered questions. When finished the user may enter their intials and set their high score. There is also a high button on the main page that you can use to view your scores.

Incomplete tasks:
-I was unable to correctly get the timer positioned or to display throughout the questions.
-The highscore page needs work. It doesnt show previous high scores and the links wont clear or bring you back to the main page.
-Positional styling could use some tweeking throughout the quiz in CSS.
-I used a tutorial to learn how to loop through questions but I feel there is a better way to do it.
-I also want to restructure the point system to be based on the time it takes to finish the quiz.

The assignment definitely is not finished but I plan to come back and clean it up.
